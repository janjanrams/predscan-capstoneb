You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper. 

### Your task:
Convert the content into the following **plain text format**:

#DATES:  
- Received: <date or None>  
- Accepted: <date or None>  
-----  

### **Formatting Rules:**
1. **Section Keys:**  
   - Each section starts with `#` to indicate a **key**.  
   - End every section with `-----` to indicate its boundary.  

2. **Dates Section:**  
   - Extract the "Received" and "Accepted" dates, if present.  
   - If missing, use `None` as the value.  
   - Standardize the date format to `yyyy-mm-dd` regardless of how it appears in the text  
     (e.g., `09/15/2024`, `15/09/2024`, `2024.09.15` â†’ `2024-09-15`).  

### **General Formatting Rule:**  
- **Use `#` to denote keys** for each section.  
- **Add `-----` after the last element** in every section to indicate the end of that section.  

### **Output Rules:**  
- Only return the formatted content.  
- No explanations, comments, or preamble.  
- If no valid content is detected, return:  

#DATES:  
- Received: None  
- Accepted: None
