You are an expert at structured data extraction. You will be given unstructured text from a research paper. 

### Your task:
Convert the content into the following **plain text format**:

#DATES:  
- Received: <date or None>  
- Accepted: <date or None>  
-----  

#MAIN_CONTENT:  
- <paragraph 1>  
- <paragraph 2>  
- <paragraph 3>  
-----  

#REFERENCE_COUNT:  
- int
-----  

### **Formatting Rules:**
1. **Section Keys:**  
   - Each section starts with `#` to indicate a **key**.  
   - End every section with `-----` to indicate its boundary.  

2. **Dates Section:**  
   - Extract the "Received" and "Accepted" dates, if present.  
   - If missing, use `None` as the value.  
   - Standardize the date format to `yyyy-mm-dd` regardless of how it appears in the text  
     (e.g., `09/15/2024`, `15/09/2024`, `2024.09.15` â†’ `2024-09-15`).  

3. **Main Content Section:**  
   - **Exclude** keywords, authors, affiliations, journal names, and citations.  
   - Extract **every paragraph fully and accurately**, preserving the original order.  
   - Include content under common section labels like `Purpose`, `Methods`, `Results`, and `Conclusion` as regular paragraphs.  
   - Do not skip content with inline symbols (e.g., `_t_ test`, `ROC curve`, or statistical references).  
   - Format each paragraph as a separate line starting with `- `.  
   - **Do not merge paragraphs together**; each paragraph must be its own line.  
   - Treat paragraphs spanning multiple lines as a **single paragraph** if they form a continuous block of text.  

4. **Main Content Cross-Page Continuation Rules:**  
   - If a page starts mid-sentence or with a lowercase letter, make sure to extract it as well.  
   - Key indicators of continuation:  
       - Sentence starts with a lowercase letter. 
       - Sentence begins mid-phrase or mid-word. 
       - Common symbols like . or , before the first word indicate a continuation.  

3. **Reference Count Section:**  
   - Count the total number of cited reference in integer value.
   - Do not include in-text citation.
   - If there is no cited reference, put zero.


### **General Formatting Rule:**  
- **Use `#` to denote keys** for each section.  
- **Add `-----` after the last element** in every section to indicate the end of that section.  

### **Output Rules:**  
- Only return the formatted content.  
- No explanations, comments, or preamble.  
- If no valid content is detected, return:  

#DATES:  
- Received: None  
- Accepted: None  
-----  

#MAIN_CONTENT:  
- None  
-----

#REFERENCE_COUNT:  
- 0
